name: GETCDR3
description: Run in-house python script to collect the CDR3 sequences only
  from the full amino acid sequence, using the context of the CDR3 which
  begins with amino acids which commence after a YYC and terminates with
  the amino acids which precede a WGQ. We also compute the length distribution of
  these CDR3 sequences.
  Note that this approach is not robust to amino acid sequences which do not follow
  this pattern, or contain the motifs in other positions.

params:
  - out_dir:
      type: string
      description: |
        The pipeline's output directory. By default, the module will
        output files into `$out_dir/MODULE_NAME`
  - publish_dir:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specifying this parameters, appends the string to the path for
        the standard output directory provided by `$out_dir`.
      default: MODULE_NAME (see out_dir)
  - publish_dir_mode:
      type: string
      description: |
        Provide a value for the Nextflow `publishDir` mode parameter
        (e.g. copy, link, ...)
  - publish_results:
      type: string
      description: |
        Whether or not to publish results into `publish_dir`. Set to `none` to not
        publish any files at all; to `default` to publish all relevant files.
      default: set to 'default', i.e. publishes all relevant files.

input:
  - meta:
      type: map
      description: |
        The value is passed in a tuple, with the reads.
        This is a groovy map containing sample metadata which is
        generated in the main script. The following fields are expected
        by the module:
      - sampleID:
        type: string
        description: Sample identifier
  - translated:
      type: file
      description: |
        FASTA file of aminoacid sequences as translated by in-house script and
        clustered by CD-HIT
output:
  - fasta:
      type: tuple
      description: Metadata map (meta) together with FASTA seqience file (type: file)
      pattern: "*_cdr3.fasta"
  - hist:
      type: tuple
      description: |
          Metadata map (meta) together with histogram calculated from
          clusters (type: file)
      pattern: "*_cdr3.hist"
